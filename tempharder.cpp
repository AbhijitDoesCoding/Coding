/*Hereâ€™s a more challenging problem statement that still aligns with the goal of practicing templates and sorting:

---

**Problem Statement:**
Develop an object-oriented program in C++ to implement a generic sorting system that can handle sorting arrays of both integers and floating-point numbers. Additionally, implement the sorting system to handle custom data types with comparison logic defined by the user.

The sorting system should support multiple sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort) via template classes and should allow the user to choose which sorting algorithm to apply. Implement a `Sorter` template class that includes overloaded sorting functions for each algorithm and test the implementation with arrays of `int`, `float`, and a custom `Student` class. The `Student` class should include attributes like `name`, `ID`, and `GPA`, with the sort order based on GPA.

**Objectives:**
1. To learn advanced template techniques in C++.
2. To understand how to implement and utilize multiple sorting algorithms using templates.
3. To practice creating and using custom data types with template-based sorting.

This assignment requires managing templates and sorting logic for custom types and would deepen understanding of both C++ templates and sorting techniques in object-oriented programming.*/
